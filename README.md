### About project

My project is a simple user list management application where you can filter the users by name, username, email, and phone. The users are fetched from the jsonplaceholder API and the data is stored in the redux store.

### What I learned

I learned how to use redux in my project and how to pass data from the redux store to the component. I also learned how to use the useDispatch and useSelector hooks to dispatch actions and select data from the redux store. I learned how to create reducers and actions and how to use the extraReducers property to handle asynchronous actions. I also learned how to use the createAsyncThunk function to create asynchronous actions. I also learned how to use the createSlice function to create a slice of the redux store. In all of that I learned how to use typescript with redux and how to create types for the redux store.
